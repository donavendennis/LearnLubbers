LearnLubbers is a comprehensive web-based learning management system (LMS) designed to emulate and enhance the functionality of popular educational platforms like Canvas. Built using ASP.NET Core 8.0 and Entity Framework Core, this solution provides a robust platform for both instructors and students to manage the entire educational process digitally. The system features role-based access control, ensuring that instructors and students have appropriate permissions tailored to their needs. Instructors can create and manage classes, publish assignments with customizable parameters, grade submissions, and track student progress. Students can register for classes, submit assignments through various methods, view their grades and performance metrics, and make tuition payments securely through Stripe integration.

The application is architected using a clean, modular approach with separate projects for data access, domain models, and utility functions. It implements the repository pattern through a Unit of Work design, providing a consistent and maintainable way to interact with the database. The user interface is built using ASP.NET Core Razor Pages with Bootstrap for responsive design, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices. Advanced features include a comprehensive calendar system using FullCalendar.js for scheduling and event management, PDF generation for receipts and documents using DinkToPdf, email notifications via MailKit, and data visualization through Google Charts. The solution also includes a robust testing framework with both unit tests and Selenium-based UI tests to ensure reliability and functionality.

LearnLubbers stands out for its comprehensive feature set that addresses the complete educational workflow, from class registration and management to assignment submission, grading, and payment processing. The system's intuitive interface, combined with its powerful backend capabilities, makes it an ideal platform for educational institutions looking to digitize their learning management processes. With its extensible architecture and modern technology stack, LearnLubbers provides a solid foundation that can be further customized and expanded to meet specific institutional needs while maintaining high standards of security, performance, and user experience.
